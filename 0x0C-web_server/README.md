Concepts
--------

*For this project, students are expected to look at this concept:*

-   [What is a Child Process?](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/110)

Background Context
------------------

[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-sysadmin_devops/266/Screenshot+2017-07-06+19.24.05.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZg4uJkEa-4&feature=youtu.be&hd=1)[](http://savefrom.net/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAZg4uJkEa-4%26feature%3Dyoutu.be%26hd%3D1&utm_source=ff&utm_medium=extensions&utm_campaign=link_modifier "Obtenir un lien direct")

In this project, some of the tasks will be graded on 2 aspects:

1.  Is your `web-01` server configured according to requirements
2.  Does your answer file contain a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure an Ubuntu machine to fit requirements (meaning without any human intervention)

For example, if I need to create a file `/tmp/test` containing the string `hello world` and modify the configuration of Nginx to listen on port `8080` instead of `80`, I can use `emacs` on my server to create the file and to modify the Nginx configuration file `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`.

But my answer file would contain:

```
sylvain@ubuntu cat 88-script_example
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Configuring a server with specification XYZ
echo hello world > /tmp/test
sed -i 's/80/8080/g' /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sylvain@ubuntu

```

As you can tell, I am not using `emacs` to perform the task in my answer file. This exercise is aiming at training you on automating your work. If you can automate tasks that you do manually, you can then automate yourself out of repetitive tasks and focus your energy on something more interesting. For an [SRE](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/9I0WufjKdW3TZA2EVrGnlQ "SRE"), that comes very handy when there are hundreds or thousands of servers to manage, the work cannot be only done manually. Note that the checker will execute your script as the `root` user, you do not need to use the `sudo` command.

A good Software Engineer is a [lazy Software Engineer](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/sRY__axKNHhNW0SVmsUC_A "lazy Software Engineer"). ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-sysadmin_devops/266/82VsYEC.jpg)

Tips: to test your answer Bash script, feel free to reproduce the checker environment:

-   start an `ubuntu:16.04` Docker container
-   run your script on it
-   see how it behaves

Check out the Docker concept page for more info about how to manipulate containers.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Transfer a file to your server**
  * [0-transfer_file](./0-transfer_file): Bash script that transfers a file
  from Holberton's client to a server.
  * Accepts four arguments:
    * The path of the file to be transferred.
    * The IP of the server to transfer the file to.
    * The username that `scp` connects with.
    * The path of the SSH privtae key that `scp` uses.
  * `scp` transfers the file to the user home directory `~/`.

* **1. Install nginx web server**
  * [1-install_nginx_web_server](./1-install_nginx_web_server): Bash script
  that configures a new Ubuntu machine with Nginx.
  * Nginx listens on port 80.
  * When querying Nginx at its root `/` with a `curl` GET request,
  it returns a page containing the string `Holberton School`.

* **2. Setup a domain name**
  * [2-setup_a_domain_name](./2-setup_a_domain_name): A text file containing
  the domain name set up for the server through Gandi.

* **3. Redirection**
  * [3-redirection](./3-redirection): Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu
  machine with Nginx.
  * Setup is identical to [1-install_nginx_web_server](./1-install_nginx_web_server)
  plus:
    * The location `/redirect_me` returns a `301 Moved Permanently` redirection
    to another page.

* **4. Not found page 404**
  * [4-not_found_page_404](./4-not_found_page_404): Bash script that configures
  a new Ubuntu machine with Nginx.
  * Setup is identical to [1-install_nginx_web_server](./1-install_nginx_web_server)
  plus:
    * Features a custom 404 page containing the string `Ceci n'est pas une page`.

* **5. Design a beautiful 404 page**
  * A custom-designed 404 error page for my server, accessible at
  [bdbnb.site/404](http://bdbnb.site/404).

* **6. Deploy fast, deploy well**
  * [fabfile.py](./fabfile.py): A Python Fabric configuration file defining
  the following functions:
  * `pack`
    * Usage: `fabric pack`
    * Creates a tar gzipped archive of the current directory named
    `holbertonwebapp.tar.gz` in the local directory.
  * `deploy`
    * Usage: `fabric -H <remote server IP> deploy`
    * Uploads the archive `holbertonwebapp.tar.gz` to the `/tmp`
    directory of the remote server.
    * Creates the directory `/tmp/holbertonwebapp` in the remote server.
    * Untars `holbertonwebapp.tar.gz` in the `/tmp/holbertonwebapp` directory
    of the remote server.
  * `clean`
    * Deletes the archive `holbertonwebapp.tar.gz` in the local directory.
